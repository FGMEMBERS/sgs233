Install the aircraft file directly to your fs98 aircraft folder..

copy the gauges to your fs98 gauge folder... if asked to overwrite 
any gauges just say yes...


The airfile for this craft has been tweaked to offer a better glide 
ratio - also the regular schweizer panel has been replaced with a
special higher visibility panel created by Max Roodvelt and the 
instruments have been altered to the english version...

Panel Note:  The panel has a small instument window that can be 
removed or activated by pressing the shift key and #2 key together.

All in all we've made what we feel will be a great training sailplane.
